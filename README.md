# Indian States and UTs Guessing Game

A fun, interactive Turtle graphics-based game to test your knowledge of the states and union territories (UTs) of India. This game displays a blank map of India, and the player guesses the names of the states. Each correct guess is labeled on the map, while missed states can be saved for later learning.

## Features

- **Clickable Prompt:** Enter the names of Indian states/UTs to guess their locations.
- **Live Feedback:** Correct guesses are labeled on the map at precise coordinates.
- **Educational:** Missed states are saved in a CSV file for further study.
- **Replayability:** See your progress and try to complete all entries.


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pandas` package
- `turtle` module (present in the standard Python library)

### Files Included

- `main.py`: Main game script.
- `India-States-UTs.csv`: CSV file containing state names and their coordinates.
- `India.gif`: Map image used as the game background.
- `India.jpg`: (Optional) Preview image for the README.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository** or download the files to your local machine.
2. **Add Map Image:** Ensure `India.gif` (a blank map outline) is present in your working directory.
3. **Install required packages:**  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

4. **Run the game:**  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Play

1. A map of India appears with no state names.
2. Enter the name of a state or UT in the prompted dialog box.
   - The game is not case-sensitive but expects correct spelling.
3. Correct guesses are displayed on the map.
4. Type `Exit` anytime to quit and save a list of missed states in `states_to_learn.csv`.
5. Try to guess all 28 states to complete the game!
